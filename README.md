# LULEM

This is a module for the LULEM (LU Decomposition with Large Expression Management)
package. It contains the functions to solve systems of linear equations with large
symbolic expressions. The module uses the LU decomposition to solve the system
of equations. It is hopefully an improved version of the code provided in the
following PhD thesis:

- Wenqin Zhou, *Symbolic Computation Techniques for Solving Large Expressions*
  *Problems from Mathematics and Engineering* (2007), Faculty of Graduate Studies,
  The University of Western Ontario London, Ontario, Canada.

We would like to thank *Jacques Carette* for providing the original code that we have used to develop this module.
