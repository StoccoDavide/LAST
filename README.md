# LULEM

This is a module for the LULEM (LU Decomposition for Large Expression Matrices) package. It contains the functions to solve systems of linear equations with large expressions. The module uses the LU decomposition of the matrix of the system. It is hopefully an updated and ready-to-use version of the code provided in the following PhD thesis:
