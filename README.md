# LULEM (Linear Algebra Symbolic Toolbox)

This is a module for the `LAST` (Linear Algebra Symbolic Toolbox) module. It contains the functions to solve linear systems of equations with large symbolic expressions. The module uses symbolic full pivoting LU and QR decompositions to solve linear systems. The `LEM` (Large Expressions Management) module is used to avoid expression swell.

The code in this repository is hopefully an improved version of the code provided in Wenqin Zhou's PhD thesis *Symbolic Computation Techniques for Solving Large Expressions*.

We would like to thank *Jacques Carette* for providing the original code that we used to develop this module.

## Dependencies

The `LULEM` Maple module depends on the `LEM` (Large Expressions Management) module. This module contains functions to avoid expression swell and it is freely available at this [link](https://github.com/StoccoDavide/LEM).

## Installation

Firstly, install the dependency. The `LEM` module is freely available at this [link](https://github.com/StoccoDavide/LEM). For the installation of this dependency module, refer to the instructions present on the repository homepage.

To install the module you must have first installed Maple. Then open the `PackAndGo.mw` file and use the `!!!` button to *execute the entire worksheet*.

Then test the library in a Maple worksheet or document by typing:

```
> LAST:-Info(LAST); # Maple < 2021
> LAST:-Info();     # Maple >= 2021
```

Alternatively, you can use one of the tests file provided in the `tests` folder. If the module is loaded without errors, it is done!

## Module description

If you want a full description of the `LAST` module type:

```
> Describe(LAST);
```

This command will generate a brief description of the module and all the procedures and other objects present in the `LAST.mpl` file, which will be (very) similar to the following code.

```

### ðŸš§ Attention! ðŸš§

Maple object-oriented programming features have slightly changed in 2021, which online documentation states:

> As of Maple 2021, if the method has a formal parameter named `_self`, references to its object's local or exported variables may be written without prefixing them. That is, `_self:-variable` may be written as just `variable`. Maple will add the `self:-` prefix internally when the method is simplified.

> As of Maple 2021, a message-passing form of method call can be used, which will automatically pass the object as an argument if the method has a formal parameter named `_self`.

> Another way to invoke a method, similar to that used in other object-oriented languages, was introduced in Maple 2021. In this form, the object name is qualified by the method name, `object_name:-method_name( argument )` just as it can be in the function mechanism described above. However, the *object can be omitted from the argument sequence*.
